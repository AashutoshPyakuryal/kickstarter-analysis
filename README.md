# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Deliverable 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
Deliverable 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
Deliverable 3: A written analysis of the results 
### Purpose
This Weekly Challenge Project for Module 1 was an opportunity to practice some of the concepts learned within the first two weeks of the course, by conducting an analysis of the Kickstarter data that focused on the outcomes based on launch date for theater specific fundraisers and the outcomes of plays based on the dollar amount of their fundraising goals.  In conducting these analyses, skills learned in the module such as creating pivot tables, charts, filtering data and using functions to perform calculations. 


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For Deliverable 1, the analysis that was performed included creating a "Years" column based on the Date Created Conversion column, creating a pivot table in a new worksheet entitled "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" that is filtered results to show outcomes for theater fundraisers. With the data extracted through this analysis, the final task was to create a line chart that showed successful, failed or canceled projects based on the month the project was launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For Deliverable 2, the analysis performed included using the Countifs function to calculate the amount of successful, failed and canceled projects, finding the sum of the total projects, calculating the percentage of each outcome, and creating a line chart that visualizes the percent of each outcome based on initial fundraising goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges included formatting excel functions correctly and sizing and labeling the chart.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that can be drawn based about Outcomes based on Launch Date is that the summertime, specifically May and June, were the months that had the most amounts of successful launches, while the winter, especially December, had the least amount of successful launches. Another conclusion is that the amount of canceled projects seem to be more or less constant throughout the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A conclusion about outcomes based on goals is that had goals between $1000 to $4,999 were the most successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation was that this dataset was a smaller sample size of the bigger kickstarter data and cannot necessarily be applied to projects in other categories. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Bar graphs for both deliverables would be good to compare the data.
